Analysis of Bike Share Data - Divvy Chicago Dataset

Business Task:
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.


1.	ASK PHASE

Objective (Ask) - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


2.	PREPARE PHASE

Data Source: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Data is organized by months and considered to be credible since it was directly downloaded from the source website.
Data from the past 1 year has been downloaded from the divvy data site containing 12 csv files from Oct 2020 to Sept 2021.

3.	PROCESS PHASE

In the process phase, we will decide on the tools to use to perform the data analysis effectively.
This phase will mainly involve Data Cleaning and Manipulation so that data is ready to be analyzed effectively.
Since the data is approx. 1 GB in size, we will be using Python to perform the following tasks:
-	Data Collection and Merging
-	Data Cleaning 
-	Data Manipulation
-	EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
-	Data Visualizations

After downloading the 12 datasets, we will need to import the datasets to create separate dataframes. Then we will clean and manipulate data to perform EDA.

4.	ANALYZE PHASE

We will perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the cleaned and organized data. Data Aggregation, Calculations are all part of this phase. This is the phase where trends are identified which will be further visualized in the next Share phase.

5.	SHARE PHASE

Visualizations are created in this phase to share the findings with the stakeholders. Visualizations need to be effective and polished in order to effectively communicate to the executive team/stakeholders.
Visualizations can be made using Python or Tableau. Here, we have used Python package Seaborn to create the clear charts and heatmaps.

6.	Act

This the last phase of the Data Analysis process. In this phase Conclusions and Recommendations need to be provided to the stakeholders so that they can make data-driven decisions.
